Here's how such a system could work, along with a simple scenario:

Scenario: Buying a Digital Product

Step 1: Initiation
1. User A (Buyer) contacts the escrow bot in a Telegram chat.
2. User A provides details about the transaction, including the product they want to buy, the agreed price, and any additional terms.

Step 2: Escrow Setup
1. The bot generates a unique escrow address for the transaction. This address is controlled by the bot and is associated with a smart contract on the blockchain.
2. The bot shares the escrow address with both User A and User B (Seller).

Step 3: Deposit
1. User A sends the agreed-upon amount of cryptocurrency to the escrow address provided by the bot.
2. The bot monitors the blockchain for the incoming transaction and confirms the deposit.

Step 4: Confirmation and Delivery
1. User B confirms that they have the digital product ready for delivery.
2. User B provides a delivery confirmation to the bot.

Step 5: Release or Refund
1. Upon receiving the delivery confirmation, the bot provides both User A and User B a time window during which any disputes can be raised.
2. If no disputes are raised within the specified time frame, the bot automatically releases the funds from the escrow to User B.
3. If a dispute is raised, the bot intervenes and gathers evidence from both parties.
4. Depending on the outcome of the dispute resolution, the bot either releases the funds to User B or refunds the funds to User A.

Step 6: Completion
1. The transaction is considered complete once the funds have been released to User B or refunded to User A.
2. The bot sends a confirmation message to both parties.

This system ensures that both the buyer and seller are protected in the transaction. The buyer knows that their funds are held in escrow until they receive the digital product, and the seller knows that the funds are secured and will be released upon successful delivery.
